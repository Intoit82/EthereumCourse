Advertiser - Publisher location based blockchain

Bidding system
==============

1. Creating a bidding system within the blockchain between advertisers and publisher per location.

  a. The Advertiser will issue a contract which include:
   * location
   * Maximum payment
   * Duration of the campaign
   * Time limit for the contract in the blockchain

  b. Publishers will issue offers for publish the campaign according to the advertiser terms with their own bid.
     (must be lower or equal to the maximum payment)

  c. The contract will settle the connection between the advertiser
     and the lowest bid for creating the campagin. 

  d. The contract should handle more than 1 advertiser per location - giving priority for the highest payment at any given time.


Ad Campaign implementation
==========================

2. Once the advertiser and the publisher are connected by their own unique ids - the advertisers can place their own content of data
   for example a picture in a contract so only the connected publisher can publish the campaign using the advertiser's data.

3. The Publisher than communicate to the advertiser using the blockchain that the campaign was published successfully or has failed.


Dapp possible implementation
============================
4. Dapp that will display the data of the campaign or a Dapp that will display the bidding system at any given time

Hub
============================
 Add a "factory" / "hub" that can deploy instances of the contract as needed.
